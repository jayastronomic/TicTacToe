# Tic Tac Toe Game README

Welcome to the README for my Tic Tac Toe project! This document will provide an overview of the technologies used, the development process, the problem-solving strategies employed, and details about the game itself.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Used for implementing the game logic and interactivity on the frontend.
- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout for the web application.
- **CSS**: Styles the user interface and enhances the visual experience.
- **Express.js**: Used to serve my the webpage
- **Ruby on Rails**: Utilized for storing user data, such as game history and scores.

## User Stories

- As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
- As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
- As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
- As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
- As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
- As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page

## Planning and Development Process

In the beginning, I started by sketching out wireframes and understanding the user stories to know how the game should look and function. I set up the project structure with HTML, added basic styling with CSS, and gradually integrated JavaScript to create the game logic.

Throughout the development process, I encountered challenges such as managing the state of the game, handling user inputs, and determining the winner. I addressed these challenges by breaking down the problems into smaller tasks and seeking solutions through online resources, forums, and documentation.

I followed an iterative development approach, regularly testing the game to identify and fix bugs. Version control using Git allowed me to track changes and easily revert to previous versions when necessary.

## Problem-Solving Strategy

When faced with complex issues, I adopted a step-by-step problem-solving strategy:

1. **Understanding**: I made sure to thoroughly understand the problem before attempting to solve it.
2. **Research**: I searched for similar problems and solutions online to gain insights.
3. **Breakdown**: I divided the problem into smaller parts to tackle them individually.
4. **Testing**: Rigorous BDD helped identify any unforeseen issues.
5. **Refinement**: I iterated on the solution, optimizing and improving it.

## Unsolved Problems

In future iterations of the project, I plan to address the following unsolved problems:

- Implement a multiplayer feature to allow players to compete against each other online.
- Enhance the user interface to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Add more animations and sound effects to make the game experience more engaging.

## Winning Logic

To determine the winner, I implemented a winning logic that checks the game board after each move. It scans rows, columns, and diagonals for matching symbols (X or O). If a winning pattern is found, the game declares the respective player as the winner.

## Favorite Function

### `Matrix.computeWinner()`

This function iterates through the game board to check for winning patterns. It examines rows, columns, and diagonals to find matching symbols.

## Conclusion

Developing this Tic Tac Toe project was an enriching experience that allowed me to apply various technologies and problem-solving strategies. I learned valuable lessons about game development, frontend-backend integration, and the importance of planning and iteration. I look forward to continuing to enhance this project in the future and building upon the skills I've gained.
